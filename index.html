        <p>
            My name is Jason McDonald,<br>
            I live in northern Bexar county along the Comal and Bexar border.
            When I finished middle school in NISD I moved here and attended 
            Smithson Valley High. Some hobbies of mine include video games and cars, especially classics.
            My dad actually gave me a 1965 Chevy Pickup for my first vehicle Junior year and we still have it. I got 
            my love for cars from him.
